                    Online doctor consultation, also known as online medical consultation, is a method of virtually connecting patients and doctors. It is a simple and convenient way to obtain online doctor advice using doctor apps, telemedicine apps, or platforms, and the internet.

                    All of the doctors are licenced medical practitioners. Along with qualifying degrees, experience, research, and a track record of practise are all considered before a doctor is credentialed with Heka Healthy you and given access to answer patient questions.

                    Our doctors will provide expert advice on your problem and assist you in determining the next steps, which may include additional tests, medication recommendations, or lifestyle changes. Few cases necessitate a face-to-face examination, and we do ask patients to share pictures or reports if possible in order to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>
